##What is [ArchAssault] ?

>The ArchAssault Project is an Arch Linux derivative for penetration testers, security professionals and all-around Linux enthusiasts. This means we import the vast majority of the official upstream Arch Linux packages, these packages are unmodified from their upstream source. While our Arch Linux base is primarily untouched, there are times were we have to fork a package to be able to better support our vast selection of tools. All of our packages strive to maintain the Arch Linux
standards, methods and philosophies.

##What is this?

This is base/archlinux with the ArchAssault repo activated for your convenience.

Be sure to update the arch packages before creating your own Dockerfile:
RUN pacman -Syyu
